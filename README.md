# Phoenix Chronicles
Chronicles is a simple 1.20.1 questbook mod made to solve the niche and vast issues when making a questbook for your modpack.

It is focused on trying to integrate with the community, provide everything a questbook mod would need, and throw some more into the mix.

It has compat for
- Gregtech:Modern
- Phoenix Guilds
- Phantasia
- PhoenixCore
- FTBTeams

It also depends on PhoenixWiki for the shared theming with the rest of the PhoenixSuite 

Made to be an alternative to **FTBQuests** (or ftbq) but still have its own unique feel and cadence. 
There is a built-in **FTBQuests** importer that can handle importing 
*quests, player progress, chapters, categories, rewards, and tasks*.
Though `filter tasks` will have to be remade since those use a seperate mod not in base **FTBQuests**.

## Wiki link
We have a small in progress wiki for all PhoenixSuite mods, if it is missing any important info or you would like to help,
feel free to ping me on discord by the username of Phoenixvine.

[Wiki](https://omicron-industries.github.io/PhoenixSuite/wiki/) 

## Getting started as a dev and/or packdev.
You will need the minecraft development plugin and the mermaid plugin.
The minecraft formatting colors plugin is also highly suggested. 
Checking the wiki is also very helpful as well as there being some more resources down below.
And ofc last but not least feel free to ask for help in the discord

## Major feature list.
Below is a chart of the major features and how they compare to other mods in Chronicle's niche.
There is also a chart of what we do better or at parity to what others do.
For more information on any of the features, check the wiki (or if that doesn't exist) ping Phoenixvine on discord.

> NOTE. All comparisons are against **base FTB Quests on 1.20.1**. These comparisons do not cover FTBQ addons or the 1.21.1 version of FTB Quests.

### Legend: PR = At Parity, AA = Advantage, PA = Partial, N/A = Not freely applicable but still important.

```
// Heading. Levels 1-6(# -> ######) ({flat} if you don't want any level of header to collapse).
"# Power Basics 
// Supports all base mc formatting codes.
Unlike §aRF power§r, EU power requires care. Match cable amperage to your machine's draw.

## Cable Ratings

// Traditional markdown table, renders how you would expect ingame.
| Tier | Amps | Cable |
|---|---|---|
| LV | 1A | Tin |
| MV | 2A | Copper |
| HV | 4A | Gold |

// Renders a red warning callout with the error emoji.
:::warning Don't Skimp
Undersized cable §cburns and is destroyed§r. Always round up.
:::

// Collapsed by default section.
:::spoiler Why this matters
Fixed in the 0-loss cable rework: multi-amp-source and multi-face-input bugs no longer apply, so a single overloaded cable segment is the only real risk now.
:::

// Tick boxes that are persisted on client.
- [ ] Craft a Tin Cable
- [ ] Wire your first LV machine
- [x] Read this page

// Code block (which are click to copy), hover tooltip, and item rendering examples.
Need the item? `minecraft:redstone` -- click to copy the id, or hover this: [item:minecraft:redstone|Used for basic circuits]

// Opening a PhoenixWiki page from either chronicles or another mod using it, or opening an online link. 
See also [Rich text guide](wiki:phoenix_chronicles/wiki#rich_text) or the [Archive entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5l5UodFzMo) for lore.

// Conditonal statements, works with choronicle flags, checking if a mod is loaded, and many more. Check the wiki for more examples (currently WIP).
:::if flag:mod:gtceu
GregTech is loaded, so cable coverings are available too.
:::

// Renders the text below it larger (or smaller) depending on the given scale.
{scale:2.0}
This whole block renders 20% larger.

// The below two are an example of a footnote (defined at bottom, can be rendered anywhere.)
Footnote example[^amps].

[^amps]: Amps determine how much current a cable can carry before burning out.",
